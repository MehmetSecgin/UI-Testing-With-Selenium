# The Endpoints:

## We have 2 different endpoints:
* [Add/Remove Elements](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/add_remove_elements/)
* [Key Presses](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses)

For adding and removing elements, we used small JavaScript scripts that was on the site.
* addElement()
* removeElement()

Because trying to find dynamically created buttons was taking so long. We just made the script just like how you did it in Drag and Drop file.

And For Key Presses page, we simply got the input panels and first sent keys like "A", and then sent special characters such as "Back Space".
